The Stick protocol is an end-to-end encryption protocol for social networks based on the Signal protocol.
The Stick protocol was implemented to be a superset to the Signal protocol making the Stick protocol
logic external to the Signal protocol. However, a few files had to be changed internally in the Signal
protocol. These files are listed in this directory "internal". In the Stick protocol implementation,
these modified files are actually imported from a customized Signal protocol repo:

These files are listed here just for reference.
